## splitset.pl
Code to separate an input list file (expected file format for APoc) into subsets based on values in one of the columns of the list file. 
Usage: ```./splitset.pl [-h] [-s True/False] [-c column_index] file_to_be_split number_of_subsets'''

-h gives help on usage. 
-s decides whether the set is sorted as being divided into subsets.
-c is an integer value that determines which column in the file is being used to sort the list. 
file_to_be_split path to file which contains a set of lines that will be split into separate files. 
number_of_subsets is an integer value that determines the number of subsets to create. Output files will be split using the same name as the file_to_be_split but with appended subset numbering to denote.
