# APoc-on-ANDES

This repo contains programs and files to run APoc against a PDB library. APoc can perform numerous structural alignment tasks but, for our analyses, we are mainly focused on the TMalign function for a query structure against a library of structures. 

## Subdirectory Contents:
apoc -- Source code, binary, and examples of APoc.
scripts -- Auxiliary perl scripts for preparing APoc runs and parsing its output.
runs -- Scripts for running APoc on Andes with a focus on TMalign. 

Each subdirectory contains its own README file with focused details.
